   <h1>Noncommutative Noetherian Ring</h1>
   <p>In mathematics, more specifically in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a Noetherian ring is a ring that satisfies the ascending chain condition on left and right ideals; that is, given any increasing sequence of left (or right) ideals:

    there exists a natural number n such that:
    
    Noetherian rings are named after Emmy Noether.
    
    The notion of a Noetherian ring is of fundamental importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the ideal structure of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both Noetherian rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker–Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals. This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for Noetherian rings beginning with the notion of the Krull dimension.

    Try setting the height of the html element to 100% as well.

html, 
body {
    height: 100%;
}
Body looks to its parent (HTML) for how to scale the dynamic property, so the HTML element needs to have its height set as well.

However the content of body will probably need to change dynamically. Setting min-height to 100% will accomplish this goal.

html {
  height: 100%;
}
body {
  min-height: 100%;
}

thanks, this seem to remove the white bar on short pages, but now on pages which height exceeds the browser window height I get a 20px white bar at the bottom :| – bodyofheat Jul 11 '11 at 19:01

ok I found out! it works if I add html,body{min-height:100%;} :D – bodyofheat Jul 11 '11 at 19:32

Note: if you use the body {min-height} version then you cannot use .body-child{height: 100%} trick. – Salman A Dec 6 '14 at 9:52

best answer is with CSS3, using vh -> body { height: 100vh } - check answer here stackoverflow.com/a/25829844/2680216 – Adriano Resende Oct 2 '15 at 17:53

@bFunc I have this chrome issue to. html{height:100%;} body {height:auto} do the job. – GBMan Apr 13 '16 at 8:49

As an alternative to setting both the html and body element's heights to 100%, you could also use viewport-percentage lengths.

5.1.2. Viewport-percentage lengths: the ‘vw’, ‘vh’, ‘vmin’, ‘vmax’ units

The viewport-percentage lengths are relative to the size of the initial containing block. When the height or width of the initial containing block is changed, they are scaled accordingly.

In this instance, you could use the value 100vh - which is the height of the viewport.

Example Here

  </main>

  <nav class="nav-tabbar">
   <ul>
    <li>
     <a href="#">
      <i class="fa fa-home"></i>
